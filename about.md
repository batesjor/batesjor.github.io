I'm Jordan Bates! I am a local to the San Luis Obispo area, and am studying biochemistry at Cal Poly SLO! 

Outside of chemistry, my interests include drumming, writing, and going on walks.

I'm a current Noyce Associate in Cal Poly's Noyce Scholars program, and will have a future in chemical education.
